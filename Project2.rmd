#Coursera Statistical Inference Course Project

This is part two of the project for the class on statistical inference. For this project we will be analyzing the ToothGrowth dataset found in R. We will address the following questions using this data:

1) Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 
2) Provide a basic summary of the data.
3) Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
4) State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions. 

##Loading data and initial analysis

Load the data.
